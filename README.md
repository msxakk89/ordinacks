possible# Stackdinals

## Background

Can you imagine an [Ordinal](https://github.com/casey/ord) giving birth to Stackdinal? In 1837, Charles Darwin thought of a tree of life where leafs and branches represent species and nodes of the tree represent a point in the past where a _common ancestor_ has been split into two groups that then evolve independently.  

![Darwin's first tree of life](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/04/17/DarwinSketch.article.jpg?width=620&quality=45&dpr=2&s=none)

The way it roughly works in evolution is that _entire population_ is split geographically (or otherwise) in a way that prevents breeding between the two separated groups. These gene pool groups then evolve independently due to differences in natural selection pressures leading to emergence of distinct, yet closely related, species.

A similar idea was recently used in movie [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Way_of_Water). Colones Miles Quaritch has already died, but somehow, his psyche has been embedded in new Miles Quaritch avatar.

Now it is important to note that an avatar of Miles Quaritch does not capture a true evolutionary process because evolution works on groups, not individuals. However, there are some notable similarities, especially below _logical facts_. Pay attention to these as logic described in them will form the basis of __Stackdinals smart contract build on top of Stacks blockchain__:

- The avatar is directly _derived_ from the original human. This relationship is direct and provable. In some sense the human is the "mother" of the avatar.
- The avatar is _NOT a copy_ of the original human, despite obvious resemblances.
- The avatar and the human are _distinct_ and _independent_ from each other, therefore they can evolve in their own way regardless of what is going on with the other. However these is still a possibility of them influencing each other. Although this was not the case for Miles Quaritch as he was dead while his avatar was alive!

### OK but why all this fuss about humans and their avatars in the context of Stackdinals?

Stackdinals are related to Ordinals in the same way that avatars to are related to humans:

- The Stackdinal is derived from Ordinal via a cryptographic proof of ownership. In other words, Ordinal can give birth to Stackdinal if and only if such a cryptographic proof has been presented. Therefore, a Stackdinal represents a certificate _certifying that the FIRST holder of the Stackdinal was in possession of private keys that controlled the bitcoin address holding given Ordinal inscription_.
- The Stackdinal is not Ordinal and Ordinal is not Stackdinal but there is resemblance through cryptography.
- Stackdinals and Ordinals are independent. The Ordinal can change hands, and so does the Stackdinal. Therefore the only think we can be sure of is that the first owner of Stackdinal (when it was minted) was in possession of a given Ordinals.

## Problem

We can rightly ask, what problem do Stackdinals solve?

If you are in a situation where you've got to prove the ownership of Ordinal, one option is to send the Ordinal to another address controlled by the same wallet. If no one knows that it will move to the new address and announcement is made by owner beforehand that Ordinal will move to a given address then this proofs the ownership. However this method is not recommended as it is likely to cost substantial amounts, as bitcoin network congestion increases with time. Moreover, if someone else knows about the destination address, and makes an announcement it is possible that ownership assignment becomes compromised.    

The second option is to apply digital signature upon some arbitrary message, together with the corresponding public address. This is a cost effective way to prove the ownership of Ordinal, once it is confirmed that the Ordinal exists. However, this method lacks traceability and confirmation.
