# Stackdinals

## Background

Can you imagine an [Ordinal](https://github.com/casey/ord) giving birth to Stackdinal? In 1837, Charles Darwin thought of a tree of life where leafs and branches represent species and nodes of the tree represent a point in the past where a _common ancestor_ has been split into two groups that then evolve independently.

The way it roughly works in evolution is that _entire population_ is split geographically (or otherwise) in a way that prevents breeding between the two separated groups. These gene pool groups then evolve independently due to differences in natural selection pressures leading to emergence of distinct, yet closely related, species.

A similar idea was recently used in movie [Avatar: The Way of Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Way_of_Water). Colones Miles Quaritch has already died, but somehow, his psyche has been embedded in new Miles Quaritch avatar.

Now it is important to note that an avatar of Miles Quaritch does not capture a true evolutionary process because evolution works on groups, not individuals. However, there are some notable similarities, especially below _logical facts_. Pay attention to these as logic described in themm will form the basis of __Stackdinals smart contract__:

- The avatar is directly _derived_ from the original human. This relationship is direct and provable. In some sense the human is the "mother" of the avatar, and contrary to the popular belief
- The avatar is _NOT a copy_ of the original human, despite obvious resemblances.
- The avatar and the human are _distinct_ and _independent_ from each other, therefore they can evolve in their own way regardless of what is going on with the other. However these is still a possibility of them influencing each other. Although this was not the case for Miles Quaritch as he was dead while his avatar was alive!

### OK but why all this fuss about humans and their avatars in the context of Stackdinals?
