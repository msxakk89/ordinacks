# Stackdinals

## Background

Can you imagine an Ordinal giving birth to Stackdinal? In 1837, Charles Darwin thought of a tree of life where leafs and branches represent species and nodes of the tree represent a point in the past where a _common ancestor_ has been split into two groups that then evolve independently.
